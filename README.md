# Redlining-map-of-Detroit

Policy interventions can have led to segregation in the United States. One such policy intervention is the use of ‘residential security maps’ to determine which neighborhoods would be granted government- backed low interest rate mortgages. This Project uses the segregation data in Detriot, and show how it affects the social-economic factors (like househould income). 


These maps were used explicitly to exclude neighborhoods with high African American representation from receiving government investment. Those neighborhoods, were marked in red, and the practice has become known as redlining.
